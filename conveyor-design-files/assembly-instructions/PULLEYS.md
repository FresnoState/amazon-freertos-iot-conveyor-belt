# Belt Pulley Subassemblies
The belt pulley subassembly consists of three steps:

* Install magnets for RPM sensing.
* Install heat set inserts.
* Attaching 100mm threaded rod (axle) to pulley.

## Magnets
We use small 6mm magnets embedded in on of the belt pulleys to detect RPMs. In separate section we detail the Hall Effect sensor that is used to sense the magnetic fields from the rotating pulley. Polarity is important so you probably will need to setup a quick hall effect experiment to detect which way you need to install the magnets [here is a good YouTube video that details how to do this](link).

Depending on how you printed this part you may need to chamfer the inner edge of the sockets so the magnets can be pressed in.
