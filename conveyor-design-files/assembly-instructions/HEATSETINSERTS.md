# Heat Set Inserts
Heat set inserts are brass female threaded inserts that allow you to add durable mounting points to 3D printed parts. We use these because threads in plastic parts wear out quickly. On the conveyor belt the are used in a few places. First we provide a grid of mount points on the back of the conveyor belt to attach additional sensors or actuators etc. Second we use them to assemble major parts of the conveyor belt including:
* Attaching the conveyor front and back pieces to the [center](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-center.stl) structure.
* Attaching the conveyor [legs](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-leg.stl) to the [front](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-front-one-piece.stl) and [back](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-back-one-piece.stl).
* Attaching the [Switch Cover](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-switch-cover.stl) to the back of the conveyor.
* Attaching the [back access port](../3d-stl-files/conveyor-back-access-port-cover.stl) to the back of the conveyor.
